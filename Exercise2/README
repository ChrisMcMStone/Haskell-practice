Edit the file Exercise1.hs and define the "undefined" code given
there.  More instructions are given in the file as comments. When you
are done, submit in Canvas, when the exercise is available in Canvas.

To run the test bench, type, in a terminal, in the folder containing
Exercise1.hs,

  $ make

This will run your Exercise1.hs file and tell you which fragments pass
our tests.

(1) Don't change the other files in the folder containing
Exercise1.hs, and keep them there, and don't remove the module name,
as otherwise the test bench won't work, which is what we use for
automatic marking.

(2) For your submission to get a non-zero mark, it is necessary that
your file compiles without syntax errors. 

A file with syntax errors get zero as its mark, even if some portions
of it would compile without modification and pass the test.

(3) Only questions that pass the test bench can get any mark.
